# Samply Chakra Theme for NYPL Design System

This is a [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com) theme that adds NYPL's design tokens, and adapts the components to look at work the way we expect. There is a [storybook](https://nypl-chakra.vercel.app/) available here.

I have also added a custom `RequiredIndicator` to show how composable Chakra is. When a component doesn't work for us, we can import the basic components used to build it and customize them without having to start from scratch. This example swaps out the standard "\*" required indicator for NYPL's use of "optional" or "required" text on a form input.
